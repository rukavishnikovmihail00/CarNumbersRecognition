# CarNumbersRecognition
Number recognition using OCR Tesseract and OpeCV with filters and contours  

There should also be a folder named Images and Cropped.
Load some pics with autos to the Images folder and check out the result.
It`s not always as accurate as it could be, but I think the reason is
OCR Tesseract itself.
